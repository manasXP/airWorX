O2 Conc. for mass replication

Primary Motivation

We want to assemble a O2 Conc. equipment which can be built using off the shelf parts and can generate 20L/min of process grade oxygen (90 percent or higher) which is ideal for O2 needs of Covid Patents.

The end goal is to increase the purity to 99% so that it can be substituted with Liquid O2 supplies in hospital in emergency. 

Technology

PSA -> Pressure Swing Adsorption

We are solely focused on PSA Columns to build the prototype.
